# Building

The decomp toolchain was created for Linux & MacOS users. While it isn't a hard requirement, if you're running Windows its advised that you [setup WSL](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install) with an Ubuntu-like distro for the easiest setup.

The instructions below assume you're running a form of Linux (WSL or native).

## 1. Set up dependencies

* Python 3.6 or newer with [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installation/)
* Ninja
* CMake 3.13+
  * If you are on Ubuntu 18.04, you must
      first [update CMake by using the official CMake APT repository](https://apt.kitware.com/).
* ccache (to speed up builds)
* llvm-objdump

Ubuntu users can install those dependencies by running:

```shell
sudo apt install python3 ninja-build cmake ccache libssl-dev libncurses5 llvm
```

If you are running Ubuntu 23.10 or later, the `libncurses5` package won't be available anymore. You can install it from
the archive using:

```shell
wget http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/pool/universe/n/ncurses/libtinfo5_6.3-2_amd64.deb && sudo dpkg -i libtinfo5_6.3-2_amd64.deb && rm -f libtinfo5_6.3-2_amd64.deb
```

For other systems, please check for the corresponding `libncurses5` backport, for
example [ncurses5-compat-libs](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/ncurses5-compat-libs) for Arch-based distributions.

Additionally, you'll also need:

* A Rust toolchain ([follow the instructions here](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install))
* The following Python modules: `pip install capstone colorama cxxfilt pyelftools ansiwrap watchdog python-Levenshtein toml pyyaml`

## 2. Set up the project

1. Clone this repository. If you are using WSL, please clone the repo *inside* WSL, *not* on the Windows side (for performance reasons).

2. Run `git submodule update --init --recursive`

3. Acquire the **original v1.0.17 `main` NSO executable**.
    1. Acquire an NSP dump of v1.0.17. [Dumping guide](https://zeldamods.org/wiki/Help:Dumping_games#Switch)
    2. Setup [hactool](https://github.com/SciresM/hactool) and put your dumped `title.keys` in `$HOME/.switch`.
    3. Run `hactool [path to the NSP] -t pfs0 --outdir=extracted`.
    4. `cd` into `extracted`.
    5. Find the largest NCA.
    6. Run `hactool [path to largest NCA] -t nca --exefsdir=exefs`
    7. `exefs/main` is the NSO.

4. Run `tools/setup.py [path to the NSO]`
    * This will:
        * install tools/check to check for differences in decompiled code
        * convert the executable if necessary
        * set up [Clang 4.0.1](https://releases.llvm.org/download.html#4.0.1) by downloading it from the official LLVM website
        * patch Clang to match Nintendo's changes
        * create a build directory in `build/`
    * If something goes wrong, follow the instructions given to you by the script.
    * If you wish to use a CMake generator that isn't Ninja, use `--cmake_backend` to specify it.

## 3. Build

To start the build, just run

```shell
python3 tools/build.py
```

By default, a multithreaded build is performed.

To check whether everything built correctly, just run `tools/check` after the build completes.

You can check the current progress with `python3 tools/common/progress.py`.

## 4. Decompilers

For instructions on setting up a decompiler, see [DECOMPILERS.md](DECOMPILERS.md).
